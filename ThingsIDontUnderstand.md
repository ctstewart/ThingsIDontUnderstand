# Things I Don't Understand...

## About Git

1. What's the best way to "rollback" a commit?
2. What's the most organized way to see the current differences between two branches by file?

## About Github

1. How do pull requests work? I thought they were a request to integrate a branch based on its state upon creation. I could be wrong, but it seems to instead work by adding to the request every time that branch has a new commit pushed to it.
